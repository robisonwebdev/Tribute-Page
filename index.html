            <h2>Facts about Peregrine Falcon's</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Peregrine Falcons are the largest falcon over most of the continent, with long, pointed wings and a long tail.</li>
                <li>Adults are blue-gray above with barred underparts and a dark head with thick sideburns.</li>
                <li>Juveniles are heavily marked, with vertical streaks instead of horizontal bars on the breast.</li>
                <li>Peregrine Falcons catch medium-sized birds in the air with swift, spectacular dives, called stoops. In cities they are masterful at catching pigeons.</li>
                <li>They often sit on high perches, waiting for the right opportunity to make their aerial assault.</li>
                <li>Peregrines can be seen all over North America, but they are more common along coasts.</li>
                <li>People have trained falcons for hunting for over a thousand years, and the Peregrine Falcon was always one of the most prized birds. Efforts to breed the Peregrine in captivity and reestablish populations depleted during the DDT years were greatly assisted by the existence of methods of handling captive falcons developed by falconers.</li>
                <li>The Peregrine Falcon is a very fast flier, averaging 40-55 km/h (25-34 mph) in traveling flight, and reaching speeds up to 112 km/h (69 mph) in direct pursuit of prey. During its spectacular hunting stoop from heights of over 1 km (0.62 mi), the peregrine may reach speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) as it drops toward its prey.</li>
                <li>The oldest recorded Peregrine Falcon was at least 19 years, 9 months old, when it was identified by its band in Minnesota in 2012, the same state where it had been banded in 1992.</li>
